  <h1>6 for 26</h1>
  <p class="date">December 31, 2025</p>
  <p>New Year's is always resolutions.. grinding harder + chasing more. But those things are <a href="https://x.com/kevsanji/status/1985788389023760528">cringe</a>, so here are six flips for the big <b>2026</b>. 🍧</p>

<ol>
  <li>Skip New Year's resolutions altogether
    <p>Most crash and burn because they're chasing some perfect version of yourself. Instead, try one small experiment each month—no pressure, no overhaul. Tiny tweaks stick way better than January drama.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Make room for rest and boredom
    <p>Hustle culture says go nonstop, but real creativity and energy come from doing nothing sometimes. In 2026, block off unscheduled time. Good ideas show up when you're not forcing them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Do what feels like play to you
    <p>Forget forcing "passion" or ambition. Find the stuff that energizes you naturally—however weird or boring it seems to others. That's where lasting success hides.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Get good at deep focus
    <p>In a world full of AI shortcuts and multitasking, sustained attention is rare—and powerful. Train yourself to think, read, and write without distractions. It'll set you apart more than speed ever could.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Subtract before you add
    <p>Everyone says stack more habits and goals. No, start by cutting what drains you: bad commitments, clutter, old baggage. Letting go often frees up more growth than piling on new stuff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Prioritize real-life connections over digital ones
    <p>Screens are easy, but in-person hangs and asks pay off way bigger (face-to-face requests work 34x better, apparently). In 2026, show up in the same room as people. That's where the good stuff happens.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
